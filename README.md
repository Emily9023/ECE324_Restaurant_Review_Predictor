# ECE324 Restaurant Review Predictor
Goal: Predict Yelp star ratings based on features about a restaurant. 
# Step 1: Data Collection
In the Data Collection directory, the yelp_scraper.py file was used to scrape Yelp. This data is included in the JSON_Files Directory (along with a collab file that combines the data into a single JSON file). 

The raw data from web scraping is compiled in totalRawData.json within the JSON_Files directory. 

There is an Archive folder with documenting our previous attempt at using the Google Reviews API (and the data collected through that method). 
# Step 2: Data Pre Processing
In the Data Pre Processing directory, there is an ipynb notebook called Data Cleaning. The cleaned data is stored in the cleanedData.csv file.
#Step 3: Models
In the Models directory, we created 3 models (LinearLogisticRegression and 2 Boosting Models).
